Reflections and Comments:

* How did this go, overall?
  * I think overall the lab went well.
* What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?
  * It was nice to practice with CSS and all the possible ways to get to the end result. There was a lot of trial and error moments to get the navigation bar to line up but I learned some new things along the way. Utilizing Google was a nice tool/aide to have when trying to figure out how to do something.
* How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
  * The lab didn't take very long but I ended up spending a little more time tweaking things and seeing what happened if I changes this or that. I thought it was a pretty fun lab. I can see how someone could easily spend hours creating a web page. The possibilities are endless!
